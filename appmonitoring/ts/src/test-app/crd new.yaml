            Configures application monitoring in the current namespace. Multiple CRs of this kind are allowed within a namespace. 
            
            CR named _default_ will be used for every workload in the namespace unless speicifically overridden through annotations.
            To use a different CR _crName_ for a particular workload, mark it with _instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-\<language\>="\<crName\>"_ annotation.

            Multiple annotations (for different languages) may be applied to the same workload. Annotations must be placed at the workload's spec level (_spec.template.metadata.annotations_) level. Currently, only deployments are supported.
            
            Examples of annotation usage:

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="true"
            Uses the default CR for the namespace with Java instrumentation (regardless of which languages the default CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="false"
            Disables all instrumentation regardless of which languages the default CR specifies, or which language-specific annotation is used.

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="true"
            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="true"
            Uses the default CR for the namespace with Java and .NET instrumentation (regardless of which languages the default CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="true"
            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="false"
            Uses the default CR for the namespace with Java (regardless of which languages the default CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="alternativeCrInThisNamespace"
            Uses a different, non-default CR named _alternativeCrInThisNamespace_ found within the namespace with Java instrumentation (regardless of which languages that CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="crName1"
            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="crName2"
            Invalid configuration, deployment will fail.

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="crThatDoesNotExist"
            Invalid configuration since the CR does not exist, deployment will continue with no instrumentation.

                        Before this configuration is applied, Azure Monitor already collects pod console output and uploads it to ConsoleLog / ConsoleLogV2 tables in the associated Log Analytics Workspace by Azure Monitor Container Insights.
                        Logs that were output via the console lose distributed tracing context and cannot be visualized in the end-to-end transaction details experience.

                            Note: enabling this flag without disabling console output (either through the flag in this section or by removing the console adapters when configuring the SDK) might result in double collection of logs and higher cost.
